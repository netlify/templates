This is an example starter app that is showcasing how to build a form in
[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), host it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and use
[Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) to send a notification using
[Courier](https://www.courier.com/) on every form submit.
