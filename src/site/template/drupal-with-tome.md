A starter blog using Drupal and Tome, prebuilt with full text search and Netlify Form support out of the box.

Tome allows you to use Drupal locally and commit your content to Git, removing the headaches of security updates and hosting costs.

Other features:

- Ability to filter and crop images on upload, in WYSIWYG or a field
- Blur-up functionality for images, similar to GatsbyJS
- A theme with dark mode support
- Already configured SEO, path aliases, Lunr search, and an XML sitemap and RSS feed
- Ability to embed code snippets in WYSIWYG that are highlighted in the frontend
