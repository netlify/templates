üå± Publish a Dendron Workspace to Netlify! ‚ö°Ô∏è Made with Dendron, which uses `Next.js` to build a static website out of your notes, documentation, and/or blog content written with an extended Markdown.

If you have been experimenting with different approaches to Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), then Dendron may be the tool you've been looking for.

### What is Dendron?

[Dendron](https://dendron.so) is an **open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool** built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools, Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) **easy to get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.

Kevin Lin originally created Dendron because he'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let him easily add and find notes from within his knowledge base.

Traditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks.

Dendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our [hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64/) that relies on the combination of [hierarchies](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409), [schemas](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052), and [path based lookups](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3).

With Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you.**
