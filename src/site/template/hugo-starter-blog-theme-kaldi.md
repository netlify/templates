A Hugo boilerplate for creating a blog site backed with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for content authoring and [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) for CMS user authentication.

It has an asset pipeline using Gulp and Webpack for processing JavaScript with Babel, and CSS with PostCSS.
