### Why should I use Netlify CMS as a content management system?

> Because it's convinient. If you want to write/edit/delete posts anywhere (even on your phone), you can go to `https://your-blog-name.com/admin`, log in and do whatever you want.

### I'm a non-tech user, can I still use it?

> Sure. This template is a ready-to-use blog. The only things you need to do is to register a [Github](https://github.com/) account and a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account (all free) and click a some magic buttons, everything will be ready in 5 minutes (no kidding :sunglasses:).
