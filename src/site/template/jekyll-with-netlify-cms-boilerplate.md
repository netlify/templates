A simple Jekyll boilerplate for creating a fast, static website on Netlify with a continuous deployment workflow and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for content editing.

This template provides sample pages, blog posts and a working contact form powered by [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling).
