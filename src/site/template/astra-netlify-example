The [Astra To-Do App](https://youthful-shirley-77ac42.netlify.app/) is an example application using Astra (Cassandra as a Service) and Netlify.

This example is fully functional and walks you through the steps needed to get the application up and running quickly.

It can be used as the basis for many other applications, as the API interactions for GraphQL, document and REST APIs are demonstrated.
